## Results

this folder contains some of the output files produced by the unitn HPC center (not the result matrices, but the performance scores).

Note: the code that ran on the cluster is a slight variation of the branch 'older_version' (older version of MPI, available in MPICH-3.2)

the numbers on the files are the number of milliseconds used to complete a specific step of the algorithm (counted by process 0 using gettimeofday())
